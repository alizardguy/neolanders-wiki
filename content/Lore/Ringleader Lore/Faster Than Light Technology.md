Though the speed of light is a basic physical law, many forms of circumventing the universal speed limit have been discovered throughout [[The Multiverse]].

## Quantum Entangled Communication
Quantum Entangled Communication (QEC) is a method by which digital information can be transmitted instantly across any distance.

## Induced Quantum Tunneling

Induced Quantum Tunneling (IQT), is a form of [[Faster Than Light Technology|FTL technology]] that utilizes the inherent instability of a particle's location in space to instantaneously move it from one physical location to another without needing to traverse the distance between.

IQT was developed by [[Rusty Manufacturing]] in the year in an effort to streamline shipping processes. Unfortunately, the energy required to operate the IQT effect makes it highly inefficient for large amounts of mass or long distances when attempting a one-way transfer.

## Tear Gates

A tear gate is a highly unstable form of travel. In order to procure one, spacetime must be manipulated on both a macro and micro scale to coalesce two points into one. The only known user of tear gates is [[The Swarm]]
