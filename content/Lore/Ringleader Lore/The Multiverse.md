The story of [[The Ringleaders]] takes place within The Multiverse, which is a [[Lore Information|Narrative Device]].

The Multiverse is composed of Underspace, Overspace, and The Timelines.

---
## Underspace
Underspace is a zero-dimensional point of infinite energy that forms the foundation of The Multiverse. It is separated from three dimensional spacetime by what is known as the Lower Membrane.

---
## Overspace
Overspace is a fifth dimensional filament that houses The Timelines within it. Paradoxically, it is defined as being a place where existence itself cannot occur.

---
## The Timelines

A Timeline is a fourth dimensional object within which all forms of comprehendible existence take place. They are composed of a lower membrane, upper membrane, and one or more interiors.
