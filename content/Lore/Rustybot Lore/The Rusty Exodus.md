The Rusty Exodus is a period of roughly 16 hours where [[Rustybot]] decommissioned all [[Rusty Manufacturing]] assets in the Sol system and cut communications with Earth entirely.

Due to earth's reliance on Rusty Manufacturing for raw materials and the upkeep of the [[The Datanet]], the exodus caused near-total societal collapse on an unprecedented scale.
