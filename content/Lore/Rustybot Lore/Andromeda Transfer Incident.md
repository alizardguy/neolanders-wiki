After the successful return signals of the [[Quindol]] probes, [[Rustybot|Toby Tsur]] would confine his consciousness to a [[Drones|Rusty Drone]] and transport himself to the distant star system using [[Faster Than Light Technology|Induced Quantum Tunneling]] as both a publicity stunt and proof of concept for intergalactic travel.

If all went according to plan, Toby would make planetfall in the drone while a new launch window opened so that Earth would be able to send additional parts to him. He would then begin building the infrastructure for an IQT Anchor travel hub.

Unfortunately, the activation protocol did not proceed. Rather than booting once in orbit, Toby was locked into a state of total sensory deprivation for 3.39726 years of subjective time.

The trauma experienced by Toby in this event is thought to be the most important factor behind his subsequent personality shift, and the cause of [[The Rusty Exodus]].
