Bitbots are a subset of Rusty [[Drones]] that consist of a hover thruster, display screen, and interaction beam array. 

The primary purpose of a Bitbot is to perform autonomous maintenance, especially in small or otherwise hard to reach places.

Unlike the majority of [[Rusty Manufacturing]] robotics, Bitbots are true A.I., meaning they are synthetic neural networks and not a copy of an uploaded human mind.
