The Quindol System is a star system in the Andromeda Galaxy that was discovered in the year (something like 2172 maybe), and projected to have a similar layout to the Sol system. Using [[Faster Than Light Technology]] invented by [[Rustybot]], various probes were sent to chart the system and its bodies.

The Quindol System consists of 6 notable gravity wells (in order of distance from the center):

[[Quindol (Star)]]
[[Quindune]]
[[Quindlet]]
Venus-like
Asteroids
Ring planet
Ice planet
